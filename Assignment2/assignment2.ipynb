            "* **Expert 1 (Logic) acknowledged AI's rapid progress:**  They pointed out AI's ability to mimic styles, generate technically proficient images/music/writing, and automate tedious tasks.  Logically, this *could* displace artists doing very repetitive, skill-based work (e.g., stock image creation, basic graphic design). They also highlighted the economic pressures that might lead businesses to favor cheaper AI-generated content.\n",
            "* **Expert 2 (Creative) emphasized the core of art is *not* just technical skill:** They argued that art is fundamentally about human expression, emotional resonance, conceptual thinking, storytelling, and communicating unique perspectives. AI, while capable of *simulating* these things, doesn't *experience* them.  It lacks genuine intent, lived experience, and the ability to truly innovate beyond its training data.\n",
            "* **Where they met in the middle:** Both agreed that AI is a *tool*.  A powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. \n",
            "    * **AI as a collaborator:**  They envisioned artists using AI to augment their abilities – for brainstorming, prototyping, overcoming creative blocks, automating repetitive tasks, and exploring new styles.  The artist remains the director, curator, and conceptual driver.\n",
            "    * **New artistic roles will emerge:**  \"Prompt engineers\" (those skilled at guiding AI to produce desired results), AI art curators, and artists who specialize in blending AI-generated elements with traditional techniques are all potential new roles.\n",
            "    * **The value of \"authenticity\" will increase:** As AI-generated art becomes more prevalent, the human touch, the story *behind* the art, and the artist's unique voice will become even more valuable and sought after.  The *provenance* of art will matter more.\n",
            "    * **Democratization of art creation:** AI lowers the barrier to entry for *creating* art, allowing more people to express themselves visually or aurally, even without extensive training. However, this doesn't diminish the value of skilled artistry.\n",

            "“Right, let’s start with the physical setup. We have a room, presumably rectangular or square, with four corners. A cat is definitively placed in *each* corner. That’s a solid foundation – four cats. The key here is the ‘in front of’ phrasing.  If we visualize this, each cat is facing the center of the room.  Because of the symmetry of a room with corners, each cat will have three other cats within its line of sight.  This isn’t about physical proximity necessarily, but about what each cat *sees*.  The geometry supports the idea that the statement isn't about cats being stacked or overlapping, but about perspective.”\n",

            "“I agree with Anya on the importance of the phrasing. The riddle is deliberately constructed to mislead. The phrase ‘in front of’ is crucial. It doesn’t imply physical closeness, or even that the cats are directly *opposite* each other. It simply means within the field of vision.  The riddle relies on our tendency to overthink and assume a more complex arrangement.  We naturally want to add cats, to create a scenario where each cat *has* three cats physically before it. But the wording doesn’t demand that. It states what each cat *sees*.  The repetition of 'each' is also significant - it emphasizes the individual perspective of every cat.”\n",

If each cat *sees* three other cats, and they are all positioned in the corners of a room, that means they are all looking at each other.  The riddle isn’t asking us to *add* cats to fulfill the ‘three cats in front’ condition. It’s stating a condition that is *already* met by the initial setup.  Each cat, sitting in a corner, can see the three cats in the other corners.  We’re being tricked into thinking there’s a hidden variable.  The riddle is a test of our ability to avoid unnecessary complexity.”\n",
